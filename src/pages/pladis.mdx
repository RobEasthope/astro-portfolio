The Pladis site is a brand new responsive, multi-lingual website for the Turkish Pladis holding group, bringing together information on their Ulker, Mcvities, and Godiva holdings.

Pladis was designed from the start as an international, multilingual site, with a requirement to be easily updated by communications staff without the need for specialist developer knowledge.
