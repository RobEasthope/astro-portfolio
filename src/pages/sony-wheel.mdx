The Sony Wheel of Fitness was the centerpiece of Haygarth’s 90 day experiential tour to promote the UK launch of the Sony Xperia Z3 in 2015.

The concept of the Sony Wheel was a simple one - hop onto the Wheel, start walking, and once the Wheel had got up to speed a POV video would play on a state of the art, curved 4K Sony TV mounted in the treadwheel.

I conducted the initial technical research, built the front end elements of the Sony Wheel UI, and planned out the user experience journey throughout the project. The physical elements of the Wheel were designed and engineered by Asylum FX.

Completed with a very short turn around of six weeks, the Sony Wheel was sent on three nationwide tours around the UK to London, Birmingham, Newcastle, and various Tough Mudder events.
