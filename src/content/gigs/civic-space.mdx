import { InternalLink } from "@/components/_base/InternalLink/InternalLink";

As the lead front end developer and architect on the <InternalLink href="/civic-space">
Civic Space</InternalLink> prototype web app, I was responsible for architecting, designing, and building the front end of the Civic Space prototype web application. Working closely with a small team of developers, I integrated satellite imagery and data visualization elements into a user-friendly interface.

The core of the app utilized React, Remix, and Mapbox technologies to enhance the application's functionality. I also had the opportunity to meet with civil society organizations to ensure that the application met their specific needs. Additionally, I implemented secure front end authentication using Auth0 and leveraged ShadCN UI components for rapid prototyping and development.

One of the key focuses during the development process was data and API security. We took measures to ensure that user data was protected at all times. To avoid vendor lock-in and ensure data security, I made use of open source libraries and self-hosted solutions.
