The Founders Factory project was a full refactor of an existing three year old site Gatsby.js site. This included:

- Switching to use StoryBlok, a headless CMS from a combination of Contentful and static content
- Rebuilding the front end code into a modular component system in parallel with StoryBlok's architecture
- Restyling and refactoring the codebase to use CSS-in-JS Styled Components and Rebass primitives components
- Individual component theming with CSM integration
- Storybook component library
- Mailchimp newsletter signup functionality
