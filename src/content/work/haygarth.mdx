The Haygarth project was a full stack redesign of Haygarth’s company portfolio and blog. The brief was to build a fully responsive site which showcased Haygarth’s creative work.

I built the majority of the front end elements as the rest of the development team and striped out the old Drupal based CMS replaced with a bespoke Laravel CMS based around simplicity and ease of use.
