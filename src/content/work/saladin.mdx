This portfolio is built with Gatsby.js and pulls it's content from a Sanity.io backend. Responsive imagery is provided automatically by Sanity and responsive video assets are processed and supplied by Mux.

Styling is done with Styled Components building off Rebass styled component primatives and Styled System global responsive theming.
