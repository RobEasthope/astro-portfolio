The YSL Rock Chick project was a part of national experiential campaign tour to promote the relaunch of YSL Black Opium.

The concept was for fans to film themselves dancing to Icona Pop’s ‘I Love It’ and then let other fans vote in a nationwide poll for the best video to win L'Oreal products and invites to fashion events.

Fans were able to film themselves in video booths located in Selfridges and other retail locations or alternatively uploaded homemade videos from Vine, Instagram, and Facebook. The submissions were then uploaded to the site and then served via Vzaar.
