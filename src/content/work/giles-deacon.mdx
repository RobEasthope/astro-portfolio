Giles Deacon is a British fashion designer, best known for his playful designs and his collaboration with leading UK high street retailers.

I was the sole front end developer providing advice to 3cc to help design and then build the front-end of the Gile's new portfolio and public relations site.

The site made extensive use of waterfall layout design patterns and was integrated into Laravel's PHP Blade templating engine.
